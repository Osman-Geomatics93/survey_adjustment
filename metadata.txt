about=Production-ready least-squares adjustment plugin for professional surveying workflows.

    Features:
    - 2D Classical Adjustment (distances, directions, angles)
    - 1D Leveling Adjustment (height differences)
    - 3D GNSS Baseline Adjustment (with full covariance)
    - Mixed Adjustment (classical + GNSS + leveling combined)
    - Robust Estimation via IRLS (Huber, Danish, IGG-III)
    - Constraint Health Analysis with actionable messages
    - Optional Auto-Datum for quick exploration
    - Chi-square global test, redundancy numbers, MDB, external reliability
    - Error ellipses with confidence scaling
    - JSON + HTML reports
    - GeoPackage output with adjusted points, ellipses, residual vectors
